# Election_Analysis

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of this election audit analysis was to determine who one the election along with determining the county with best voter turnout. With the data available we were able to use our code to pull out the needed information without needing to count every line of data.

## Election-Audit Results
In total, there were 369,711 votes cast in this election. The majority of those votes came from Denver County (82.8% or 306,055 votes) compared to the two smaller turnouts from Jefferson County (10.5% or 38,855 votes) and Arapahoe County (6.7% or 24,801 votes). Of those votes, there was a clear winner of the election. Diana DeGette won the election with a total vote count of 272,892 or 73.8% of the total votes. The runner-ups were Charles Casper Stockham with 85,214 total votes or 23.0% and Raymon Anthony Doane with 11,606 total votes or 3.1%.

## Election-Audit Summary
This analysis can be used for more elections to come with the ability to analyze even more data. For example, if there was a "City" column added in to the data, we could easily add some code to determine the voter turnout for each city. Another useful bit of analysis could be to determine the voting results for each candidate by County/City so we can detemine how each area is voting. We would only need to update the code to look at each county individually.
